Changes made in one location, such as marking an email as read, are automatically applied to the other location. POP3 is also an email protocol. However, the data is not synchronized between the client and the server. SMTP is used for sending email, and is typically used in conjunction with the POP3 protocol. MIME is an email standard that is used to define attachment types, and allows extra content like pictures and documents to be attached to email messages.",
